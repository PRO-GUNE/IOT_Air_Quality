# IOT_Air_Quality
Develop an IOT device that monitors the indoor air quality and notifies the users of the air quality level
It includes a interactive dashboard implemented using Node-RED.

Currently the first prototype is created with a TVOC and CO2 sensor, Temperature and Humidity sensor and a Dust sensor.

## Components used
- ESP32 (Micro Controller)
- Plantower PMS7003 (Dust Sensor)
- DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor)
- SGP30 (TVOC and CO2 Sensor)
